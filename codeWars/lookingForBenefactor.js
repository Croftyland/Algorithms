  Title:
    Looking for a benefactor
  Description:
    The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant.
    The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first
     n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the
     association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30.
     After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he made a mistake. Could you help him?
    if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149
    The function new_avg(arr, navg) should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer)
     that will permit to reach the average navg.

  Notes:
    - all donations and navg are numbers (integers or floats depending on the language), arr can be empty.
    - See examples below and "Test Samples" to see which error is to be thrown.
        new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 92) should return 645
        new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 2)
        should raise an error (ValueError or invalid_argument or DomainError)
        or return `-1` or ERROR depending on the language
*/


const newAvg = (arr, newavg) => {
    const totalDonations = arr.reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0)
    const result = newavg * (arr.length + 1) - totalDonations

    if (result < 0) throw new RangeError('Error')
    return Math.ceil(result)
}
